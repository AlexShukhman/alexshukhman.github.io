<table><tr><td><img src=public/images/profile_no_bg.png></td><td><b>Thanks for visiting!</b><br/><br/>To give you a little more insight about me, I could tell you I’m a self-taught cloud architect, entrepreneur, designer, and engineer, but you can read that on my LinkedIn. You can read that I started a couple of companies in college called <a href="https://smop.io">Smop</a> and <a href="https://iulius.io">Iulius</a>, and that I speak English, Spanish, some German and enough French to have the superman owl on Duolingo.<br/><br/>You won’t, however, see the actually interesting things about me. You won’t see that my personal projects range from a server-free, peer-to-peer encrypted chat protocol to a Watson-based web scraper. You won’t see that in my spare time I blow glass, do wood and metal working, and study ethnomusicology. You might even miss that I’ve got a bit of a <a href="https://www.behance.net/alexjacobshukhman">creative side</a>... But that’s why I have this <a href="https://github.com/AlexShukhman/alexshukhman.github.io">pretty nifty</a> little website!</td></tr></table>
