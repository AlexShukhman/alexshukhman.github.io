    "intro": "<b>Thanks for visiting!</b> \nA little more about me, I'm a full-stack developer, cloud architect and entrepreneur. I'm an engineer by education, but as I continued learning about supply chains and stocastic systems, my mind kept wandering to the cloud. I started my first company, <a href='https://smop.io'>Smop Technologies</a> in college with a great team and as I continue to learn and develop my skills in both entrepreneurship and software development, I also continue to build companies and projects like <a href='https://iulius.io'>Iulius</a> and <a href='https://github.com/terrabl'>Terrabl</a>. I feel strongly that anyone can be a great developer, no matter your background and that if there aren't resources to help people learn, it's my job to help make them! Feel free to contact me for anything from employment inqueries to freelance to just advice and stories about my experience in the freelance and startup worlds!"
