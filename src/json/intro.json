I'm an engineer by education, but as I continued learning about supply chains and stochastic systems, my mind kept wandering to the cloud. I started my first company, <a href='https://smop.io'>Smop Technologies</a>, in college with a great team and an amazing community.

Feel free to contact me for anything from employment inquiries to freelance to just advice and stories about my experience in the freelance and startup worlds.<br><br><i>Also feel free to check out my chops by perusing the <a href='https://github.com/AlexShukhman/alexshukhman.github.io'>GitHub repo</a> of this project!</i>"
